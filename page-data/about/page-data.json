Potius inflammat, ut coercendi magis quam dedocendi esse videantur. Ne in odium veniam, si amicum destitero tueri. Ne amores quidem sanctos a sapiente alienos esse arbitrantur. Quid ergo aliud intellegetur nisi uti ne quae pars naturae neglegatur? Quis istud, quaeso, nesciebat? Primum divisit ineleganter; Hoc unum Aristo tenuit: praeter vitia atque virtutes negavit rem esse ullam aut fugiendam aut expetendam. Et ille ridens: Video, inquit, quid agas; In his igitur partibus duabus nihil erat, quod Zeno commutare gestiret.</p>\n<p>Nemo nostrum istius generis asotos iucunde putat vivere.\nEst enim tanti philosophi tamque nobilis audacter sua decreta defendere. Sed eum qui audiebant, quoad poterant, defendebant sententiam suam. Atqui, inquam, Cato, si istud optinueris, traducas me ad te totum licebit. Quam ob rem tandem, inquit, non satisfacit? Vestri haec verecundius, illi fortasse constantius. Quorum sine causa fieri nihil putandum est. Non modo carum sibi quemque, verum etiam vehementer carum esse? Nemo nostrum istius generis asotos iucunde putat vivere.</p>\n<p>Expressa vero in iis aetatibus, quae iam confirmatae sunt.\nNe amores quidem sanctos a sapiente alienos esse arbitrantur. Quid enim de amicitia statueris utilitatis causa expetenda vides. Nihil acciderat ei, quod nollet, nisi quod anulum, quo delectabatur, in mari abiecerat. Quid enim possumus hoc agere divinius? Dic in quovis conventu te omnia facere, ne doleas. Omnes enim iucundum motum, quo sensus hilaretur. Hoc loco discipulos quaerere videtur, ut, qui asoti esse velint, philosophi ante fiant. Hoc loco tenere se Triarius non potuit. Nunc haec primum fortasse audientis servire debemus. Sin dicit obscurari quaedam nec apparere, quia valde parva sint, nos quoque concedimus; Isto modo ne improbos quidem, si essent boni viri. Quid censes in Latino fore?</p>\n<p>Quae diligentissime contra Aristonem dicuntur a Chryippo. Huius ego nunc auctoritatem sequens idem faciam. Quare obscurentur etiam haec, quae secundum naturam esse dicimus, in vita beata; Ad corpus diceres pertinere-, sed ea, quae dixi, ad corpusne refers? Huius, Lyco, oratione locuples, rebus ipsis ielunior. Aliter homines, aliter philosophos loqui putas oportere? Qui autem esse poteris, nisi te amor ipse ceperit? Aliter autem vobis placet.
