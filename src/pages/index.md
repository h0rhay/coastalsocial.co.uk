          Rosie is one of the most professional and dedicated people I’ve had the pleasure of working with. Her knowledge of Facebook advertising has made a distinct difference to Marsha By The Sea. Rosie not only immediately grasped the nature of my business but saw each campaign through with immaculate detail and excellent communication. Beyond that, Rosie is a quality person - intelligent, diligent and supportive.
