          Rosie is one of the most professional and dedicated people I’ve had
          the pleasure of working with. Her knowledge of Facebook advertising
          has made a distinct difference to Marsha By The Sea. Rosie not only
          immediately grasped the nature of my business but saw each campaign
          through with immaculate detail and excellent communication. Beyond
          that, Rosie is a quality person - intelligent, diligent and
          supportive.
