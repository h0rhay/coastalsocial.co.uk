          Rosie has been transformative to our business, from the early days, getting to know the needs of my business and developing as we grew, to create great content in a planned and strategic way. Always pushing and looking at new avenues, with a view to take things to the next level and get the right balance. I couldn’t recommend Rosie with all her drive and passion for what she does highly enough.
